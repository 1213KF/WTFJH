#Hacking Guide
##This is the guide for you to start adding modules/tools to the repo


###Modules
Modules can be generated by running ./Template.py Type Name

Current Types:

1.	SDK
2.	API
3.	ThirdPartyTools
4.	Utils

For now, it only divides modules into seperate folders to make the modules look tidy.

In the future we'll group settings based on those types.

**Please Make Sure The Types Are Correct**

Also.There is a init_XXX_hook function inside each module,which XXX in your module name.

The main tweak will call that to init your hook.Check below for details

###Names
####For Modules. 
All these must be the same.

1.	Module File Name
2.	init function name component (see Modules Part)

*Please make sure the names are short and descriptive. We generate settings button text base on module name*

####For Third Party Components
**Read ThirdPartyTools/README.md for detailed info **


####Custom Preferences
Add Your Own Preferences in **Preferences/** With Filename **MODULENAME.plist**

They will be injected into the *items* of the final Preferences Loader PLIST file

####Marcos
Two Groups Of Marcos Has Been Created For Logging Purposes.
Please Call Exactly In The Following Sequence
#####Common Logging
1.	WTInit(ClassName,methodName)  **(For C Functions. Change ClassName to Library Name. For Example dlopen corresponds to dlfcn because it's in dlfcn.h)**
2.	WTAdd(Argument,Name) **The First is the argument itself. The second is the argument name**
3.	WTReturn(Return) **Return is the return value to add**
4.	WTSave	**No Arguments. It saves the log to database.**
5.	WTRelease **Release The Memory Of The Logger**
6.	WTShouldLog **if(WTShouldLog){} to check if it's called by the app itself**

#####dyld CallBack
1.	WTCallBack(LibraryName,FunctionToCall) **Generate A Function That Call FunctionToCall() when an image which path containing LibraryName is loaded. You Can Init Hooks inside FunctionToCall**
2.	WTAddCallBack **Register the callback with dyld**

Please Note:

1.	WTAdd can be called for many times. That's for adding Arguments
2.	WTInit,WTSave,WTRelease Must Be Called Under any circumstances
3.	Add Semicolons Yourself
4.	Don't add semicolon to WTCallBack
5.	Only One Set Of **dyld CallBack** Marcos Can Be Called In A Module

####Misc
Some functions don't come with the binary and you'll have to wait the related library to be loaded 

**Example: libMobileGestalt**

I personally use a dyldCallBack for that.

You might want to dlopen() that library itself.However that will also cause performance issues
